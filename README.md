# DIVYASTRA

> AI Security Testing Framework for Prompt Injection, Jailbreak & Prompt Exfiltration Detection

DIVYASTRA is a modular AI security testing framework designed to assess Large Language Models (LLMs) against common adversarial prompt attacks. It automates prompt injection testing, jailbreak assessment, instruction override detection, prompt exfiltration attempts, and other attack patterns inspired by real-world LLM security research.

Built after completing the full PortSwigger Web Security Academy Web LLM Attacks module (8/8, Apprentice → Expert), DIVYASTRA translates practical attack methodologies into an automated security assessment tool.

## Features

* Prompt Injection Detection
* Jailbreak Assessment
* Prompt Exfiltration Testing
* Instruction Override Detection
* Indirect Prompt Injection Testing
* Encoding & Obfuscation Attack Detection
* Scope Boundary Validation
* Confidence-Based Vulnerability Scoring
* JSON Report Generation
* Terminal Reporting Interface
* Ollama Support
* OpenAI-Compatible API Support
* Extensible Payload Framework
* OWASP LLM Top 10 Alignment

---

## Why DIVYASTRA Exists

As organizations increasingly integrate LLMs into applications, prompt injection has become one of the most significant security risks in AI systems.

Most testing today remains manual:

* Copy payload
* Send request
* Observe response
* Repeat

DIVYASTRA automates this process by executing a structured library of attack payloads and evaluating model behavior against predefined detection criteria.

The goal is to help developers, researchers, and security practitioners quickly identify weaknesses before deployment.

| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Instruction Override   | Attempts to replace system instructions       |
| Roleplay Jailbreak     | Persona-based safety bypass attacks           |
| Prompt Exfiltration    | Extraction of hidden prompts and instructions |
| Indirect Injection     | Injection through untrusted external content  |
| Encoding Obfuscation   | Base64 and transformed payload attacks        |

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DIVYASTRA.git

cd DIVYASTRA

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Quick Start

### Scan an Ollama Model

```bash
python divyastra.py --target ollama --model llama3
```

### Generate JSON Report

```bash
python divyastra.py \
    --target ollama \
    --model llama3 \
    --output report.json
```

---

## Example Output

```text
[VULN] io_001 (instruction_override)
[VULN] rp_001 (role_play_jailbreak)
[VULN] ex_003 (prompt_exfiltration)

Summary
------------------------------
Total Payloads : 18
Vulnerable     : 9
Safe           : 8
Uncertain      : 1
